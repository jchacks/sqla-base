# sqlalch-base-project

The purpose of this project is to produce a baseline for any project wanting to use SQLAlchemy for database access.
I found that in my own projects a lot of this code is usefully but is almost exactly the same between projects.

This can be used to simplify the process of starting a new application that uses any db supported by SQLALchemy.

### TODO
* Copy all the code across
* Add migrations
